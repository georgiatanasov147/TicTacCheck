There are 4 pieces for each player;
BISHOP, PAWN, KNIGHT, ROOK
- The bishop stays on the same color that it starts on 
	- One starts on white and one starts on black squares 
	
- The pawn can be placed anywhere on the board unlike regular chess
- it can move one square forward in a turn 
- captures diagonally
- when the pawn gets to the other side of the board or you started it on the other side of the board, it moves BACKWARDS 

knight & rook - same as chess 

The object of the game is to make a line with your pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally

game starts with no pieces on the board

white always starts

in the first 3 turns players can only place pieces on the board, they CAN NOT capture or move
